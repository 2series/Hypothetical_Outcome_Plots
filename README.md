## Hypothetical Outcome Plots

Hypothetical outcome plots is an effective visualization method to communicate data uncertainty. This repo included several notebooks to demonstrate how this approach is applied under different analysis settings. All notebooks provide step-by-step guides of generating Hypothetical outcome plots in Python:




## Companion blog

A separate blog focusing on reviewing the fundamental theories is also available. You can find many illustrations in the blog to facilitate intuitive understanding of the abstract concepts. The blog is located here:
